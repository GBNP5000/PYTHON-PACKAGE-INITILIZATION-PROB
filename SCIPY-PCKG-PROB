      ERROR: Cannot install numpy==1.21.6 and numpy==1.22.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

      The conflict is caused by:
          The user requested numpy==1.22.3
          The user requested numpy==1.21.6

      To fix this you could try to:
      1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
      2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
